## Step 2: LabelMe annotation

## Step 3: Training a FasterRCNN Mouse Detection Head
The fasterRCNN model was trained using the openmmlab. The model format is .pth file. 


## Step 4: Training a HRnet keypoint detection model
The HRnet keypoint detection model was training using the 

## Step 5: Training a Fast Slow actition recognition model


## Step 6: Differentiation of sniffing and grooming behavior


## Step 7: Visualization of annotated behaviors 


## Step 8: Verifcation by human annotator
